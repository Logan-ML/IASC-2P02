## Concept of Time and Space Through a Multimedia Platrform

## Topic That will be covered in this post:
Both Moretti and Drucker argue that visual forms (e.g. graphs, maps, etc.) can and should be used to
represent cultural phenomena (e.g. the experience of temporality, rises and falls in genre, etc.). Moving between written and visual mediums of expression offers a model for the next generation of digital
humanities scholarship, where readers are asked to think critically across both textual and graphical
modes. As such, digital humanities scholarship should increasingly create multimodal scholarship
where readers interpret both the text and any other media (such as graphs, images, audio, and so
on). Creating scholarship that asks readers to interpret across multiple modes will distinguish digital
humanities scholarship from scholarship in the sciences.

## My Take on the Topic

The history of the deliverance of media has grown parallel to human evolution, beginning with simple cave drawings, to the now scholarly texts and videos in academia which we deem as the “proper” expression of media. Though this may be the prevailing thought in most of academia, such that as the sciences and social sciences, the digital humanities have fought for the further progression in how mediums are expressed and taught. Digital Humanists such as Drucker who argues to view data as ‘capta’ and Moretti, who examines his data through a quantitative approach have argued over the form and representation of multimedia, quite similar to that of academia itself, stating how there are proper forms of scholarships between disciplines like the sciences and humanities. It is with “this ongoing tension between materiality and informatics contributes to our understanding of how we in the academy think about multimedia in relation to other, more “legitimized” modes of scholarly practice” [Burgess & Hamming, 2011]. Burgess and Hamming state how the constant tension within academia itself has led to the slowing and erasure of multimedia forms within scholarly work. It is not until we put aside the differences of disciplines will we be able to push forward in our pursuit of better representation of information through the such forms like that of spatiality and temporality. 
“To overturn the assumptions that structure conventions acquired from other domains requires that we re-examine the intellectual foundations of digital humanities, putting techniques of graphical display on a foundation that is humanistic at its base” [Drucker, 2011]. Drucker is right in the approach to distinguish the digital humanities as its own field, as we must change the way we examine information at its base. We can approach this easily with the idea of spatiality and temporality, which examines the concept of space in a given area or induvial mind as well as the perception of time with an event or individual respectively. To be more specific by examining information and media with the lenses of temporality and speciality, the process of how academia itself views media and historical events will be altered drastically. This can be shown through the work of five notable digital humanists’ authors, and their perception on how they view and interpret media.

Regarding figure 1.1, the statistics of the reoccurrence of three specific terms (graph*, time, and space) are mapped over the work of five separate authors and represented in the combination of a line and bar graph. The data presented informs the reader that the only time the concept of both of space and time itself it considered in a graphical sense is through the humanistic approach of Drucker, compared to that of Moretti who only examines his works linearly over the course of time alone. Drucker stands alone is the analysis of multimedia scholarships, showing the new opportunity that lies in wait for an improved form of learning. Most media are presented through sole lens of time, leading to a distorted perception that we learn from it. By adding the idea of space alone the lens of time, new media as well as old media considered completely exhausted in terms of information able to be gathered from it, may be able to be re-examined presenting new findings or new growth for future progress that may not have been noticeable alone through one stagnate lens. It can also be seen in figure 1.2, that time and space are linked in the analysis of faction, so to properly analyze the concept and function of an idea, one must view it from a spatial and temporal lens.
	There are already current and upcoming examples of scholarly work employing the use of both the methodical temporal approach as well as the newer spatial approach. This can be seen in the works of Allison Muri in her examination of early modern narratives such as The Grub Street Project which examines that of both qualitative, and quantitative empirical data.  “The current map viewer, for example, allows historical data such as streets, buildings, and so on, to be layered with tours of literary or artistic works and series. Another view will display statistical and spatial information about London's print culture as represented by the locations of printers and sellers indicated on the imprints of books and pamphlets” [Muri, A, 2016]. Not only does the work of The Grub street project allow for a temporal view in the era of the culture, it allows for a spatial understanding. Works that were displayed in shops and libraries, such as books and painting can be seen. This allows to viewer to gather an understanding of not only the time period, but the perception of how it felt to among that area, with the art that would have surrounded an individual in that time period, or the works and food they would consume. This lets the viewer gather a deeper understanding than the basic statistical data that could be gathered but which The Grub Street Project still provide. 
	You may be asking yourself, what do individuals gain by adding these extra dimensions for multimedia platforms, and the answer to that is specific, as it is specific to the individual. With these additions, every individual is able to perceive the works, the life, and the atmosphere like buildings in a different light, similar to that of all the individuals living during the early modern period. It gives you a different view, from anyone else, thus recreating the time, as if you were living in it right now. This allows everyone the ability to further investigate the smallest bits of information, such as dietary restrictions of this location, to the dimension of living spaces, or even entertainment provided in this district.
This is why multimedia platforms are essential for the humanities. They provided senses and information that the sciences alone can not gather, and in time, will bring notoriety to the digital humanities itself.
