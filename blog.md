## Concept of Time and Space Through a Multimedia Platrform

## Topic That will be covered in this post:
Both Moretti and Drucker argue that visual forms (e.g. graphs, maps, etc.) can and should be used to
represent cultural phenomena (e.g. the experience of temporality, rises and falls in genre, etc.). Moving between written and visual mediums of expression offers a model for the next generation of digital
humanities scholarship, where readers are asked to think critically across both textual and graphical
modes. As such, digital humanities scholarship should increasingly create multimodal scholarship
where readers interpret both the text and any other media (such as graphs, images, audio, and so
on). Creating scholarship that asks readers to interpret across multiple modes will distinguish digital
humanities scholarship from scholarship in the sciences.

## My Take on the Topic
