## About me 

Hello everyone and welcome to my website! Currently I am a second year Medical sceinces student minoring in Interactive Arts and Sciences on Brock Universities main campus. At the current moment I have worked with Dr. Rebecca MacPherson studying in Alzheimers disesase and its progression, specifically with the intereaction of BDF and insulin signaling in the brain. I have a love for the Interactive arts and chose to follow that passion when I have the time to. Here you can find the begging of my work, and more to come!
